for details.


INSTALLATION

1. The master/ directory contains the source code to the tools. First
you must configure the build system for your build platform. Look in
the subdirectry master/mk. You need to create a symlink called platform.mk
to one of the other files (except rules.mk) in this directory. If you
do not see a file for your the version of the operating system you have
installed, look at the PORTING section below.

So, for Red Hat Linux v5.1, I'd do:

$ cd master/mk
$ ln -s ix86_linux_rh5.1.mk platform.mk
$ cd ..


2. Then, invoke make in the master/ subdirectory:

$ make

3. If everything buids, you can install it. To install in to the
default place, which is a new subdirectory called install/$(ARCH)/bin where
$(ARCH) is determined by the platform.mk file you specified in step 1, do:

$ cd master
$ make install

If you wish to install in a different directory you set the environment
variable INSTDIR to specify the directory to install things in. It will then
install in $(INSTDIR)/$(ARCH)/bin

In both cases, a directory called python is created at the same level as
the bin directory containing the python portions of the Nemesis tools.

You will find the binaries for your architecture in the bin directory thus
created.

PORTING

If you're lucky, you can get away with creating a .mk file like one of the
existing architecture.mk files. These files just define the names of 
certain programs used to build the Nemesis tools. If you come up with a new
one, we'd appreciate it if you could submit the file to us.
